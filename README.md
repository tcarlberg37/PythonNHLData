# PythonNHLData

NHLPandas.ipynb is the final project I wrote for a Python Data Science course I took.

Gretzky_vs_Ovi.ipynb was created to settle a bet on whether Alex Ovechkin could surpass Wayne Gretzky's seemingly untouchable goals record.

NBA.ipynb is a deep dive into a kaggle dataset of NBA statistics using pandas, matplotlib, and keras for data 
visualization and machine learning.

PlotlyMaps.ipynb is me learning to make plotly maps.
